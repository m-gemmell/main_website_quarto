Water bodies are formed by the presence of Proteus.
They freeze where they touch solid surfaces, allowing them to slide.
Where they touch air they let off a low constant supply of steam.

They can be described as cat like, destructively moving about one moment and lazing about the next.
They have been seen finding holes or containers and settling themselves into it.
As likely, they can be seen barrelling down hills, cutting new rivers through the dirt.

There are also other water bodies that are formed by the mixture of Proteus and another deity.
They can be very different compared to the water bodies formed soley by Proteus.

## POND WATER BODY {#pond}

(1 HP, 3D6 appear)

- Water blast (1 DAMAGE)
- 1 litre blob of amorphous animated water
- Normally birthed from the water of a pond
- Timid

__Still:__ PONDS are still beings that collect water. They congregate in groups, communicating to each other by shooting water that contains the memories of the water within them. If this water is drank, the drinker will vomit out a new POND WATER BODY the next time they eat/drink, this will reduce any healing effect of the consumed item to 0.

## LAKE WATER BODY {#lake}

(3 HP, 1D6 appear)

- Bash (3 DAMAGE)
- Water blast (1D6 DAMAGE, loses 1 health if it deals more than 3 DAMAGE)
- 5 litre blob of amorphous animated water
- Adventurous and curious

__SKIER:__ Each lake on earth has a corresponding LAKE WATER BODY. Most are impossible to find as they mainly live in water. However, they sometimes will exist on the surface travelling downhill to explore the world. Once at the bottom they will rest in appropriate holes or water bodies until they are moved by the water cycle. Drinking its water directly will act as [Holy water](/Proteus/Triton_n_Delta.qmd) but without any negative effect.

## OCEAN WATER BODY

(14 HP)

- Boiling bash (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Waterjet beam (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
- 200 litre blob of amorphous animated saltwater

__GUARDIAN:__ Each ocean in the world (Pacific, Arctic, Southern, Atlantic, and Indian) has a OCEAN WATER BODY that protects it. 
They have great power to control their ocean when within it. 
These powers are throttled when removed from their ocean, these stats detail this scenario. 
The OCEAN WATER BODY is effectively indestructible when within its ocean unless you can destroy the ocean itself.
When within its ocean it can create storms, typhoons, whirpools, and tsunamis.

## MUD TALOS

(3 HP, 1D6 appear)

- Rock punch (3 DAMAGE, CLOG)
- Rock sling (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Rocky surface (1 ARMOR)
- A pillar of oozing mud and rocks with sunken eye holes and rudimentary arms

__MIXED:__ A MUD TALOS comes about from the combination of Proteus' water and Tartarus' earth.
They can change from amorphous to a more structured form.
This allows them to disguise themselves as normal mud or ooze through small openings.

__CLOG__ weapon tag: Successful hits with this weapon clogs the equipped weapon of the target. If the weapon has moving parts required for use (such as a gun) it is no longer functional till a strip down and clean is carried out.

## COMET STARVATAR

(7 HP)

- Starlight rifle (1D6+2 DAMAGE, MEDICAL)
- Plasma punch (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- Icy and rocky exterior (1 ARMOR)
- A humanoid shaped being made from the materials of a comet
- Constantly giving off dust and gas
- Can levitate and move as if on a powered hoverboard

__COMA:__ The coma is the atmosphere around a comet from the streams of dust and gas it releases.
COMET STARVATARS are constantly moving and constantly obscured by their coma. Due to this forceful or creative rolls have a -2 penalty against them (attacks or otherwise). However, skill or quick reflexes are effect so tactical and reflexive rolls have a +2 bonus against them (attacks or otherwise).

__BOW SHOCK (BOSS MOVE):__ The COMET STARVATAR'S coma dramatically expands.
This atmosphere consists of water and dust, this will therefore cause asphyxiation to appropriate creatures.
In addition, the thick,dust laden atmosphere obstruct vision and causes weapons and vehicles to more easily malfunction.

__MEDICAL__ weapon tag: Once per mission, you may use this weapon to deal negative DAMAGE, healing the target. (F:UE)
