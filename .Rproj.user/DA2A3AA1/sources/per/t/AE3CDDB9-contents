The Supreme Asian Empire. All countries of the Asian continent except Russia with India & China co-leading uneasily.

## Primary deity

The primary deity of the SAE is [Nyxmera](/nyxmera.qmd).

## Positives

- __Variety:__ The different cultures across the empire are allowed to flourish.
- __Growth:__ The power is in a period of rapid growth. Many super and mega projects are under way in the empire.
- __Population & food:__ They have the largest population in the world. Rather than being a weakness they are able to fully utilise economies of scale with a primarily vegetarian diet to have very good food security.

## Negatives

- __Disputes:__ Many disagreements in the empire with China and India constantly arguing. This can lead to progress being impeded.
- __Totalitarian:__ Law and order is heavily enforced.
- __Static:__ Many language with no lingua franca amongst the population. This causes little movement of people across countries.
