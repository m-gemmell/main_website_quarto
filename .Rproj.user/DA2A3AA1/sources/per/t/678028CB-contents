A large company developing and selling drugs, both licit and illicit. It is an open secret they sell illicit drugs with many knowing Triton as the licit side and Delta as the Illicit side. They primarily create new drugs charging many local companies to produce, and distribute.

This is not only led by Proteans but many Gaians involved in health services. However, Gaian involvement normally is limited to the licit side.

## TRITON & DELTA SELLER {#triton_delta_seller}

(3 HP, CHOKE 5: Bout of identity crisis)

- [SIG Sauer P230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_Sauer_P230) pistol (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Hidden bulletproof vest (1 ARMOR)
- Briefcase full of order forms
- Thermos full of tea they constantly drink from causing caffeine jitters
- Heterochromia

__CHIRAL:__ This seller switches from their legal to illegal persona as quickly as they smile at their own reflection.
These personae are drastically different.
When the seller switches they don't seem to change but their whole body becomes vertically mirrored.
If killed they will resurrect as the other persona.
