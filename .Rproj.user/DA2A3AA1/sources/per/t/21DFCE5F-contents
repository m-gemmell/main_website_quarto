Two major man made cities are on the moon. These were primarily first colonised by the refugees from Japan due to the end of WW2. They have 2 major metropolises there called Usagi (Rabbit) and Kaguya. They specialise in combustion light-gas guns (large cannons with high velocity) and mechs. When they are ready they plan to take back Japan.
