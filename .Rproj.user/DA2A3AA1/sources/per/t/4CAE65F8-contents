title: "SAE military"
---

Military troops from various countries are mixed together into groups and deployed all over the SAE.
There are too many oral languages and no consensus was made for a lingua franca of the military.
Instead all members of the military learn a specialised gesture based language based on hand and arm signals and a mixture of Asian sign languages.
This allows one member of a team who understands the spoken language of the current officer in charge to distribute the commands on the field.

(3 HP, 2D6 appear)

- [Type 63 assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_63_assault_rifle) (1D6+1 DAMAGE)

- Combat knife (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Bulletproof vest (1 ARMOR)

__NUMEROUS:__ Although the SAE does not have the newest military tech they make up for it with sheer numbers of infantry.
They are eerily silent, primarily communicating in the SAE military sign language.
Due to this SAE INFANTRY are great at stealth and it is difficult to catch them unaware.
