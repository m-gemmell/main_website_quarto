    "text": "UNDER CONSTRUCTION\nDr. Petra Pufferfish is the Primeval Polytheist and a super villain. She is the only living being favoured by all the Primeval Deities. She is especially liked by Gaia, the deity of life and unity. Her plans involve the subjugation of the world so it may finally be united under her rule. Many follow her cause. They perceive her connection to all the deities as a sign of righteousness. Her chief lieutenants are Blanchard, Kohitar, and Sol.\nAs well as being a super villain, Petra is also a super scientist. She is pedantic and hates acronyms, she won’t pronounce them correctly out of disrespect. She loves long and descriptive names for her machines and harshly criticises her lieutenants when they try to use acronyms. Curiously she dislikes the arbitrary nature of people’s names and will frequently use only the first syllable when referring to people. Of course she demands all her minions to use her full name, Dr. Petra Pufferfish.\nDr. Petra Pufferfish is an expert on genetics and cloning. As with many egomaniacs she wants to live for ever and she has figured out how. With Blanchard’s technology she has frozen her body in such a way that allows her brain to function normally. Whilst frozen like this she makes clones of her self. Due to her genius these clones mature in weeks and have a copy of her mind. Additionally, they have an enhanced physique and powers. This cloning and gene editing requires a lot of energy which is made by Kohitar’s battery technology.\nThe clones only live for a year but she has made this a benefit. With Sol’s technology she is able to mind control her clones, as if she was inhabiting their body. They have explosive collars she can activate as she does not trust her clones when they are not being mind controlled by her."

Only the Ceremony, Dinner, and Consummation will have an assassination attempt.\nAll the events take place on the estate grounds. No maps of the estate are given so you can create your own vision with the prompts in the below descriptions.\n\nRehearsal dinner\nThe rehearsal dinner takes place the evening before the actual wedding. It will be in the same ball room described in the Dinner section. No assassination will take place but it is a prime time for the players to carry out some intel gathering on the hired shutterbugs.\n\n\nCeremony\nThe ceremony takes place outside in a area flanked by the Ruby River and a rock garden full of beautiful geodes.\nTHE KING is using one of their personas (Aurelia Blaine) to attend the wedding as an invited guest. During the rehearsal dinner she will will steal River’s wedding ring. THE KING will attempt to set their curse on River and the wedding ring. They will entertain and perform card tricks for the brides to get close to them.\nClue: Players will overhear one of the bridesmaids saying they have lost River’s ring as they recruit help from the other bridesmaids.\nIf not stopped the couple will turn into gold as Ruby puts River’s ring on during the ceremony.\n\n\nFigure skating break\nAfter the ceremony the wedding party will move onto an outdoor skating rink. Here, River’s past and present skaters (all guests to the wedding) will provide an amazing show.\nAsk each of your players for a name of one of the skaters, then ask them for a name and description of a figure skating move. Give a WAR DIE to the player with the skater and move the table agrees is best.\n\n\nDinner\nThe dinner takes place in a large ball room dominated by a central large ornate water fountain sculpted from rock. On one side of the room lay the tables for the dinner. On the other is a large stage and dance floor.\nThe dinner will consist of the speeches followed by the main meal. The brides will then cut their wedding cake which will lead to their first dance.\nThe designated shutterbug is THE ANTIDOTER. They have poisoned all the food with the first part of their poison and the entire wedding cake with the second part.\nClue: During the dinner the 2 brides will leave and a fog machine will go off before the dancing commences. This is the work of the THE ANTIDOTER.\nIf not stopped the couple will die of heart attacks during their first dance.\n\n\nEntertainment\nAfter watching the first dance, the guests will join in the festivities with drinking and dancing. Various famous bands will play on the stage.\nUnsurprisingly, Ruby is a big fan of Rock and Metal bands. Ask your players for some fictional bands that will be performing. Give a WAR DIE to the player with band name the table agrees is the best.\n\n\nConsummation\nAt the end of the night the newly wedded couple will leave the ball room and go to their private building within the estate. This building is secluded on top of a rock outcropping. It is flanked by the river and surrounding forest. One side of the building is a large glass wall that overlooks the Ruby River.\nIf the players are assassinating they must do so after the couple have entered the building but before they have consummated the wedding. In this case the building is guarded by 4 KRAKEN SECURITY GUARDS. The team will succeed if they kill both brides and partially succeed if they kill at least one.\nIf the players are stopping the assassinations, the last shutterbug is the THE SILHOUETTE. They will be parked a few miles away as they send in their 4 SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONES to storm the private building. The clones will try to stealthily enter but are not afraid to enter a gunfight. The team will succeed if they save both brides and partially succeed if they save at least one."

The forest is a mile above the ski slopes, on top of a ridge. An old road leads to it but otherwise snow mobiles can be used to reach the outpost.\nThe outpost is a nondescript square concrete building. It consists of 2 floors with an inner outdoor square dominated by a radio tower. The outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with one gate. Its insides and outsides are littered with detritus and garbage. The cult intentionally lets it look dilapidated so it appears abandoned.\nWhilst approaching the outpost FIST may be spotted by the patrolling MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS through outside facing windows on the first floor.\nInside the outpost murmurings can be heard from all directions. It is kept stiflingly hot with large radiators lining the walls. A strong musky smell permeates the entire air, somewhat covering the smell of mould and rot from all the garbage. The concrete walls are heavily cracked with sloppy patch jobs.\nA large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR) is covered by the garbage outside but within the fence.\nIf FIST are in active combat, make a Choke roll for Anne Lida (DEACON OF SKYUSS) every time a MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS dies.\n\nGround floor\nThe ground floor contains 6 rooms (R) with one hallway (H) circling the inner walls. The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which has a stair case). A pair of MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS patrol the hall and rooms.\nWhen entering a room (R) use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list.

Books about the worm eating the planet and Gaian philosophy books.\nBoiler room: If boiler is disabled the cultists will desperately try to fix it. The resulting cold will slow them down and harm them if cold enough.\n\nThe hallway (H) has one door to the outside front, and one door to the inner outside square with the radio tower. There are three windows looking into the square from the hallway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper floor\nThe upper floor contains 6 rooms (R) with a hallway (H) circling the outer walls. The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which connects to the radio tower). 4 MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS patrol the halls and rooms, keeping an eye out on the outside via large windows. Another 4 MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS are awake but on break in various rooms (R).\nWhen entering a room use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list. Ensure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\nThis room has a door that leads to a walkway with a ladder up to the radio tower room.\nSleeping quarters: 4 sleeping MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS.\nRecreation room: tables for cards, sofas, tv, and a library. Contains a book on paranormal creatures.\nKitchen: First aid spray present (heal 1D6, consumable)\nMakeshift armoury: M1 Thompson submachine gun (1D6 damage) & 1 combat helmet (1 ARMOR, accessory) present.\nResearch room: A place where the deacon experiments on worms. Notes on snow worms and altered cultists are present. Worm specimens including eggs. 2 Ultrasonic harmonic frequency grenades are also present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio tower room\nThis is a warm room where the Deacon of Skyuss orchestrates plans and controls their Aurora generator. It contains the radio tower controls and a ceiling hatch leading to the top of the tower.\nAnne Lida is dedicated to her cause and will never let FIST stop her. However, she is trickier and smarter than the other cultists. If cornered she will most likely activate the Aurora generator to summon the snow worms as an act to distract/kill FIST. She will attempt to escape via the hidden large SUV outside, grabbing some minions and snow worm eggs from her research room before she does so.\nThe DEACON OF SKYUSS (Anne Lida) Aurora generator is mounted on the top of the tower. Accessible by a metal ladder."

On partial successes the front team may take some losses but also kill some enemies.\n\n\nFIST’s team\nFISTS crew will consists of:\n\nThe FIST mercs\nA number of CYBORG DOLPHINS equal to 1.5X the number of FIST mercs (rounded down)\n2 CYBORG COLOSSAL SQUIDS\nA HUMPBACK WHALE SUBMERSIBLE\n\n\n\nBlanchard’s sea forces\nWhilst underwater and approaching the Iceberg the Whale teams will be attacked. FIST’s team will have to fend off a pod of 6 CYBORG ORCAS and their ORCA WRANGLER. The frontal forces will be attacked by the same enemies but in larger numbers.\n\n\nVictory\nThe main goal of FIST is to protect the HUMPBACK WHALE SUBMERSIBLE to the iceberg. It will take 3-6 turns, or however else you measure combat, to reach the iceberg. If FIST are doing well in combat it will take less time than if they are performing poorly.\nOnce the Iceberg has been reached the CYBORG DOLPHINS and HUMPBACK WHALE SUBMERSIBLE can climb onto it."

Dump yards are where trash, chemicals, and nuclear waste are disposed of by tipping it into the DOT. These sites are heavily guarded due to the contents but also to stop DOT raiders and kaiju from reaching the surface via the mouth into and out of the DOT.\nThis site was originally the Big Hole open pit quarry. However, once they found the mouth into the DOT it was developed into a dump yard. They made the hole wider and now it is used to remove the vast majority of hazardous trash for the CAC and some neighbouring countries. It is run by Carafe, a subsidiary company of Kraken.\nThe team are provided with a floppy disk by the DOT raiders to disable the security systems including automated turrets. However, it will also disable the Kaiju Sonic Disruption System (KSDS). When/if this occurs small kaiju, SCORPIUS, will rush into the dumping site only to be followed by a massive kaiju, PYTHON. PYTHON consists of three gigantic serpents connected by a giant obsidian orb.\nDouble twist, this was a plan by The Mooners to test out their CARGO MECHA against a real kaiju. Once PYTHON emerges the KSDS will reactivate, stopping further kaiju from leaving the DOT. The team will be able to pilot CARGO MECHAS hidden within cargo crates to stop the kaiju. There will also be back-up rods from god on hand if the CARGO MECHAS fail."

    "text": "The Big Hole dump yard\nThe dump yard is a large circular hole with sheer vertical walls. Dark, noisy, deep, and hot it is easy to forget you can look up at the sky. There are only two ways in and out, the Elevator and the Mouth.\nEmbedded into the cliff wall are cranes used to move cargo crates. These cargo crates fill up most of the space giving The Hole a feeling of a subterranean cargo dock. Seagulls squawk but the salt smell is replaced with that of damp, rot, and chemicals.\n\nThe Elevator\nAt the north of the hole is a large open elevator going from the surface to the bottom of the pit. It is primarily used to move loaded cargo crates down, fill of trash, and empty crates back up. So utilitarian is the elevator that passengers are transported up and down in a designated cargo crate.\nAt the surface, near the elevator, lie many train tracks and container cranes. It runs 24/7 with many trains coming and going.\nThe elevator is slow and takes a long time to go up or down. It makes up for this by being able to transport 20,000 cargo crates at a time.\n\n\nThe Mouth\nAt the south of the hole is a large cave. Within this is a Mouth of Tartarus, an entrance to the DOT. The mouth is a pitch black circle that lays completely flat to the earth. Remote controlled machines tip trash filled cargo crates into the mouth, the operators at a safe distance on the second floor of the Node.\n\n\nThe Node\nThe node is a large 5 story cylindrical building in the very centre of the Big Hole. Blacked out Windows line the entire circumference, with bright white concrete it gives off the appearance of a striped vase. Another post-modern brutalist building, walls within the building either curve parallel to the circumference or run radially.\nThe Node acts as the main building for staff with security increasing as you go up the floors. There are no stairs instead a single pill shaped elevator in the centre of the building provides access to the floors. However, this elevator requires a pair of security cards, requiring at least 2 passengers at a time.\n\nGround floor\nReception, museum, and canteen (Level 1 security)\nThe entrance of the building contains a reception and a small museum about The Big Hole and the Carafe company. It is all boring, sterile corporate propaganda. It shows how proud the company is to have automated defences to resist DOT raider and kaiju incursions.\nA large room at the back contains a canteen for the staff.\n\n\n1st floor\nLiving quarters and recreation rooms (Level 1 security)\nVarious recreation rooms with tvs, games tables, and libraries. It is a surprisingly still place, employees taking a reprieve from the exhausting labour. They live in these quarters for 14 days whilst working, then go to their homes until they want/need to work another shift.\nA separate section for security guards requires a pair of Level 3 security passes to access.\n\n\n2nd floor\nOperations and engineering (Level 2 security)\nWhere the real work in the building is done. Team leaders congregate to meet and coordinate the day to day running.\nCrane operators work within booths, remote controlling the cranes.\nThere are also workrooms for engineers to fix smaller issues and help other engineers via radio. These rooms contain many tools and manuals.\n\n\n3rd floor\nManagement (Level 3 security)\nOffices for any important members of staff. Contains a few penthouses for visiting VIPs. Furnished with expensive paintings specifically designed to fit along the curved walls.\n\n\n4th floor\nSecurity (Level 3 security)\nThis floor contains the command room for security. From here the 2 security co-heads, Arno and Lindewe watch over the CCTV cameras and relay orders to the rest of security. This same room contains all the various terminals related to the defenses. This is where the floppy disk will need to be used.\nOther rooms include contains an armoury, gym, and practice shooting range."

It will instruct their mission has changed and they must kill the invaders from the DOT. They must use what is in the cargo crates marked with the flag of The Moon, a red crescent moon on a white background. Haste is urged. Of course, if any members want to stay in the Node to reactivate and use the defenses they shoudl be allowed to try.\nSoon massive amounts of SCORPIUS will escape from from the DOT and infest the site. This will keep the security guards busy and make the team’s trek to the designated spot dangerous.\nIf they successfully arrive at the crates they will find one for each team member, this is also a good place for emergency insertions. Within each crate is a CARGO MECHA that will take the team member as its pilot. Now the team have a chance against the kaiju.\nAfter some combat with the swarm of SCORPIUS a large rattle will sound from the Mouth. This will cause the kaiju to instantly flee but many close to the cave will be decimated as PYTHON emerges. The team will be informed the mission is to eradicate it. Thankfully no more kaiju will emerge as the KDS warning ceases.\nThe team will be informed a Rod from God satellite is moving into position above the Hole. They will be able to fire this every 10 actions, or alternative option of your choice, but will need to use the handheld laser targetters within their mechas to aim it. Each Rod from God attack does 3D6+3 DAMAGE with the ANTI-MATERIAL tag (Deals double DAMAGE to vehicles and structures; cumbersome to carry around (F:UE)).\nThe site is littered with stacked cargo containers acting as obstacles to movement. Many contain hazardous, flammable, and explosive materials. Use these as the referee and players see fit.\nAdditionally, there are also large cargo cranes that could be used by the team to pin or harm PYTHON."

Now it perpetually lives as the ultimate representation of Nyxmera. None can question its authority within the suns of Nyxmera and few can match its power outside. It lives in its massive estate filled with theatres, cinemas, libraries, rooms full of TVs. Only the best are allowed to entertain the Purple Moon, and only the richest can join the viewing. They love sowing drama and comedy, having taken to trolling on elite chat boards. The purple moon can see anything and everything bathed by the Grey Moon’s light.\nFULL MOON (BOSS MOVE): The PURPLE MOON OF NYXMERA pulls itself any body within 100 metres it chooses into its pocket dimension. This flat plane is only lit by the grey moon. Escape is only possible by choice or death of the PURPLE MOON OF NYXMERA.\nECLIPSE (BOSS MOVE): All goes dark to those that can see the PURPLE MOON OF NYXMERA. The only perceivable light being the purple illumination that directly comes off the purple crated orb.\nRETURNAL (BOSS MOVE): Once the PURPLE MOON OF NYXMERA hits 0 HP it returns to the night sky as the purple moon orbiting the night sky. This will lead to world wide natural disasters due to the presence of a second moon.\nGIGANTIC weapon tag: Far too large and heavy to be held as a weapon for normal sized people."

Although a genius he is a very large, active strong man having won the first World’s strongest man compettion in 1977.\nHis family moved from Austria to Texas when he was a young child. His fascination of cold came from his family visits to the snowy mountains of Austria. He wanted to create technologies to temporarily freeze trauma patients, create temporary relief housing, and even sentient snow creatures. His dreams were never realised, his efforts always crushed by large companies such as Pumice construction and Triton & Delta who didn’t want the competition.\nHis one success is a company specialising in high protein frozen desserts.
