When they are killed they release 1 Premature Snow worm swarm. If they choke they will release 2, the cultist dying in the process.\n\n## MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS {#skyuss_mutated_cultist}\n\n(3 HP)\n\n- [M1 Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun) submachine gun (1D6 damage)\n- Large circular maw of diamond teeth for crushing (1D6 + 1 damage)\n- Sparse diamond plating on purple skin (1 ARMOR)\n- Piercing crazed purple eyes\n- Cryophobic, takes damage from the cold\n\n__DIAMOND-BONED__: These cultists ingested snow worm eggs to gain power. These mutations led to their bones being replaced by smaller interlocking diamond bones. These mutants can fit through incredibly tight passages and holes allowing them to escape and hide effectively.\n\n## DEACON OF SKYUSS {#skyuss_deacon}\n\n(6 HP, Choke 4: Activate their Aurora generator on their position)\n\n- Aurora gun (1D6+2 damage, STUN)\n- A holy figure covered in purple robes\n- Diamond plated tactical vest (2 ARMOR)\n- Purple eyes are the only sign of Snow worm influence on her body\n\n__WORM-FIDDLER__: They only want to cultivate the worms to adulthood before unleashing them upon the towns, then cities, then the world. \nSnow worms will never attack deacons and instead protect them when nearby.\n\n__STUN__ weapon tag: Those damaged by this weapon cannot move or act until their current HP changes.\n\n## Aurora generator {#aurora_generator}\n\n(20 HP, 2 armour)\n\nThis large device produces an artificial Aurora to attract Snow Worms. This can be focussed anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the generator at night. Whilst activated will attract 1 Juvenile Snow Worm every 5 minutes. It can even attract larger snow worms if present.\n\nThe device also sends out an ultrasonic frequency that deters snow worms from getting within 20 feet of the generator. Deactivation codes are held by the presiding DEACON OF SKYUSS.\n\n\n## PREMATURE SNOW WORM {#premature_worm}\n\n(3 HP)\n\n- Bite (1D6-2 damage, min 1)\n- 2 foot purple worms with leach-like mouths\n- Cryophobic, takes damage from the cold\n- Will attack all humans indiscriminately\n\n__LEACH__: These purple worms are like 2 foot long leaches like mouths. \nThey are soft, lacking the diamond rods and teeth of their older forms. \nWhen it bites their victim they attach and leach blood and heat, wrapping around appendages.\nThey will quickly crystallise a diamond coating within a minute reducing the victim's RFX by -1.\nOnce fully embedded they are near impossible to remove during the mission.\nNo other premature snow worm is able to attach to a victim whilst one is leached.\n\n\n## JUVENILE SNOW WORM {#juvenile_worm}\n\n(6 HP)\n\n- Large circular maw of diamond teeth for crushing (1D6 + 1 damage)\n- Covered in diamond rods and purple scales (1 ARMOR)\n- 10 foot purple snow worm\n- Rods also act as sensory organ picking up vibrations\n- Cryophobic, takes damage from the cold\n- Aurora-philic, Attracted and enraged by the Aurora lights\n- Will attack all humans indiscriminately\n- Deathly territorial, only permitting one other snow worm\n\n__TUNNELLER__: The snow worm keeps warm in cold climes by efficiently digging through snow, dirt, and rocks. If damaged for 3 or more damage it will escape into the ground only to re-emerge and attack from a different direction.\n\n\n## ADULT SNOW WORM {#adult_worm}\n\n(15 HP)\n\n- Large circular maw of diamond teeth for crushing (1D6 + 2 damage)\n- Covered in thick diamond rods and purple scales (2 ARMOR)\n- 100 foot purple snow worm\n- Rods also act as sensory organ picking up vibrations\n- Cryophobic, takes damage from the cold\n- Aurora-philic, Attracted and enraged by the Aurora lights\n- Usually hunts larger game than humans\n- Deathly territorial, only permitting one other ADULT SNOW WORM\n- Can reproduce sexually and asexually, laying eggs it does not care for\n\n__DIAMOND-DRILL__: The Snow Worm can naturally grow diamonds. \nIt quickly drills through snow, ice, ground, and rocks.\nIt is fast enough to keep up with a car whilst drilling but slow on top of ground.\n\n__SCRAPE (BOSS MOVE)__: The Adult Snow Worm can scrape its diamond rods against multiple enemies dealing 1D6 DAMAGE to each.\n\n## Ultrasonic harmonic frequency grenade {#ultrasonic_grenade}\n\n(Consumable item)\n\nThis grenade sends out an adjustable ultrasonic frequency.\nIt can be set to a frequency that will destroy the diamond rods of Snow worms if the users knows the frequency.\nThis will decrease the snow worm’s armour by 1 and deal 1D6 damage.\n\nThe grenade can be used on other solid objects, bye bye bones!\n\nIt contains a reusable harmonic frequency detector (as long as the grenade has not been used). Requires touching the grenade to the object tested.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/snow_worm.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nA cult who worship the great worm Skyuss.\nThey wish to feed the snow worms by any means.\n\nSnow worms normally attack other prey than humans but auroras attract and enrage them.\nThe cult uses this to cause night time attacks where they would like through their aurora generators.\n\n\n## INCUBATOR CULTIST OF SKYUSS {#skyuss_incubator}\n\n(3 HP, Choke 5: see INCUBATION trait)\n\n- Knife (worst of 2D6 damage)\n- Wrapped up in fur clothing\n- Purple eggs visibly jutting out from their skin.\n\n__INCUBATION__: These cultists are so devout to the rising of Skyuss they have grafted snow worms eggs onto their skin.
