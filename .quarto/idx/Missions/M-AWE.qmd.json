Each was skiing/snowboarding in the dark before found dead. Some bodies were not found at all.\n- __Suns of Nyxmera:__ A group stargazes every night on top of resort building. They have noticed localised Auroras. Many match nights when people went missing/found dead.\n\nThe team can freely rent and use snow mobiles (3 HP, 2 ARMOR) and other skiing/snowboarding gear provided by __The Aurora__ during the mission.\n\n### Skifry\n\n__Skifry__ is a secluded mountain town with a logo of a purple dragon bathed by the aurora.\nThe town was founded in these mountains due to the underground hot springs acting as a natural way to heat the town and produce electricity.\nUnfortunately, the underground hot spring are also the reason the cryophilic snow worms can so easily survive the cold climate here.\n\n__The Aurora__, on the outskirt of the towm, makes use of the hot water and town citizens.\n\nSome possible clues include:\n\n- __Library in the city hall:__ News articles about a radio tower abandoned in the 30s due to unexplained animal attacks.\n- __Recruiters for cult:__ Will try to recruit the players to the cult. They are careful and coy as they are currently normal humans.\n- __Hospital & morgue:__ Recent body of a victim.\n- __Indigenous centre:__ The resident story teller has the following story if asked about tales of worms.\n  - The native Waawate & Icelandic Jokla were a warlock pair of great power. They vanquished the mighty ice worm. Waawate summoned the Northern lights to attract the beast. Then Jokla encased it in ice.\n- __Strange shopper:__ A strange very wrapped up individual ([MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist)) going into the food store to buy a lot of meat, potatoes, and canned food.\n\n\n## Outpost\n\nOnce the FIST team are ready they can make their way to the Cult's outpost. \n\nAll enemy stats and items are in the following page: [Cult of Skyuss](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd).\n\nThe Cult of Skyuss' outpost is an abandoned radio tower within a forest.\nThe forest is a mile above the ski slopes, on top of a ridge. \nAn old road leads to it but otherwise snow mobiles can be used to reach the outpost.\n\nThe outpost is a nondescript square concrete building.\nIt consists of 2 floors with an inner outdoor square dominated by a radio tower.\nThe outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with one gate. \nIts insides and outsides are littered with detritus and garbage. \nThe cult intentionally lets it look dilapidated so it appears abandoned.\n\nWhilst approaching the outpost FIST may be spotted by the patrolling [MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) through outside facing windows on the first floor.\n\nInside the outpost murmurings can be heard from all directions.\nIt is kept stiflingly hot with large radiators lining the walls.\nA strong musky smell permeates the entire air, somewhat covering the smell of mould and rot from all the garbage.\nThe concrete walls are heavily cracked with sloppy patch jobs.\n\nA large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR) is covered by the garbage outside but within the fence.\n\nIf FIST are in active combat, make a Choke roll for __Anne Lida__ ([DEACON OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_deacon)) every time a [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) dies.\n\n### Ground floor\n\nThe ground floor contains 6 rooms (R) with one hallway (H) circling the inner walls. \nThe rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which has a stair case). \nA pair of [MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) patrol the hall and rooms.\n\nWhen entering a room (R) use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list. \nEnsure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\n  1. Room with stairs that lead to the next floor's hallway.\n  2. Incubation room with 3 [INCUBATOR CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_incubator).\n  3. Incubation room with 2 [INCUBATOR CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_incubator).\n  4. Recreation room with a table with some cards.\n  5. Cult of Skyuss prayer room. Books about the worm eating the planet and Gaian philosophy books.\n  6. Boiler room: If boiler is disabled the cultists will desperately try to fix it. The resulting cold will slow them down and harm them if cold enough.\n  \nThe hallway (H) has one door to the outside front, and one door to the inner outside square with the radio tower.\nThere are three windows looking into the square from the hallway.\n\n![](images/AWE_building_ground.png){width=400px fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Upper floor\n\nThe upper floor contains 6 rooms (R) with a hallway (H) circling the outer walls. The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which connects to the radio tower). 4 [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) patrol the halls and rooms, keeping an eye out on the outside via large windows. Another 4 [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) are awake but on break in various rooms (R).\n\nWhen entering a room use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list. Ensure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\n  1. This room has a door that leads to a walkway with a ladder up to the radio tower room.\n  2. Sleeping quarters: 4 sleeping [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist).\n  3. Recreation room: tables for cards, sofas, tv, and a library. Contains a book on paranormal creatures.\n  4. Kitchen: First aid spray present (heal 1D6, consumable)\n  5. Makeshift armoury: M1 Thompson submachine gun (1D6 damage) & 1 combat helmet (1 ARMOR, accessory) present.\n  6. Research room: A place where the deacon experiments on worms. Notes on snow worms and altered cultists are present.
