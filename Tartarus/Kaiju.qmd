Kaiju are giant monsters from the DOT.

## SCORPIUS {#scorpius}

(6 HP)

- Tail sting (2D6 DAMAGE)
- Claws (1D6 DAMAGE), grapples target
- Carapace (1 ARMOR)
- 2 metre long scorpion
- 2 scorpion tails with an obsidian orb at the tail base
- Cracks over body glow a dark red

__VICIOUS:__ These massive scorpions are deadly to others and themselves.
When attacking with its tail sting, if the defending player rolls a partial success the SCORPIUS takes half of its DAMAGE, the target only taking half as well.
If the defending player rolls a full success SCORPIUS takes all the DAMAGE.
DAMAGE is applied normally to the target and the SCORPIUS avoids this DAMAGE if the target is grappled by it.

## PYTHON

(72 HP in total)

A massive kaiju named after the Greek serpent that lived in the centre of the earth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)).
It consists of three 70 foot long serpents, a rattle snake, cobra, and boa.
They are connected in the middle by an obsidian orb, with the bodies of the rattles snake and cobra wrapped around the boa.

### OBSIDIAN ORB

(16 HP, 3 ARMOR)

A glowing obsidian orb with red cracks, it radiates rage. 
Whilst intact the three snakes act as one, whenever one serpent attacks the other two heads also attack.
The serpents are large creatures and so they tend to attack 3 separate targets.
If the orb is destroyed the serpent will separate, acting as individuals.

### RATTLE

(18 HP, 1 ARMOR)

- Bite (1D6+3 DAMAGE)

A gigantic rattle snake covered in red and black obsidian scales.
It's rattle pierces the soul, installing fear.

__PETRIFY (BOSS MOVE):__ Using its rattle to induce panic RATTLE changes a player's roll to a failure.
WAR DICE cannot change this.

### COBRA

(16 HP, 1 ARMOR)

- Lava spit (1D6+2 DAMAGE, INCENDIARY)

__INCENDIARY__ weapon tag: When damage is dealt, this weapon also deals 2 DAMAGE to anything within firespreading range. Deals double DAMAGE to plants. [F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))

A massive cobra able to shot lava from its fangs.
Its hood stares with red hot obsidian orbs, the light shinign off its obsidian scales.

__REIGN OF FIRE (BOSS MOVE):__ Shooting a large amount of lava in the air, lava rains from above.
For the next 10 actions ranged weapon attacks and movement are impeded (disadvantage, -2 to rolls).
Failing a movement incurs 2 damage from lava either falling or on the ground.

### BOA

(22 HP, 2 ARMOR)

- Bite (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
- Constrict, grapples and incapacitates target (2D6 DAMAGE)
- Obsidian moult (accessory)

A large boa constrictor covered in red obsidian scales.
It cares not for its partnered snakes, only wanting to las out at the world.

__OUROBOROS (BOSS MOVE)__: Consuming one or both of its fellow snakes it regains health equal to the current health of the consumed serpents (up to its max HP).
Additionally, it acquires the use of the consumed serpent's BOSS MOVES even if they have used them previously.
